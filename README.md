# Election Analysis with Python

## Overview of Election Audit

Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, is auditing the election results for the U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. Tom assigned me to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race which needs to include following results:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - The voter turnout for each county
  - The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  - The county with the highest turnout
  - The total number of votes for each candidate
  - The percentage of votes for each candidate
  - The winner of the election based on the popular vote

Furthermore, Tom's manager wants Tom and me to write a code to automate the election audit process using Python. This code will be used to audit not only other congressional districts but also senatorial distrcits and local elections.
